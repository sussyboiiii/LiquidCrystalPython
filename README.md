# lcd_emulator
This incredibly useful piece of software to emulate an lcd screen using pygame and then running it using a socket connection can be used by cloning this repo and then running main.py


It should "perfectly" mimic the behaviour of the liquidcrystal library on arduino

In main.py you can see Hello, World!



It's definitley not perfect but good enough for my use case, if you want to contribute feel free to. 
Any contrubutions are appreciated!
