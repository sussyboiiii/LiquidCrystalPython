# lcd_emulator
This incredibly useful piece of software to emulate an lcd screen using pygame and then running it using a socket connection can be used by cloning this repo and then running main.py


It should "perfectly" mimic the behaviour of the liquidcrystal library on arduino


In main.py you can see Hello, World!
